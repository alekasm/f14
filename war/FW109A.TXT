[BRIEFING]
HIGH ALTITUDE RECON: Congratulations on successfully escorting the Norwegian P-3 Orions 
out of harm's way. These aircraft will be a valuable asset to us in the future. Because their 
own supply of reconnaissance aircraft is beginning to dwindle, the Soviets have begun 
using MiG-25s as substitutes. These stripped down Foxbats are able to travel so high and fly so 
fast that they are almost impossible to catch. Your new mission is to intercept one of these 
MiG-25s over Norway, if possible.

To win this mission you or your wingman must shoot down the MiG-25 Foxbat
