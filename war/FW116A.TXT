[BRIEFING]
YAK ATTACK: The failure of our surprise attack has alerted the Soviet battlegroup to our
presence. Now that the Soviets know where we are they have launched a strike of their own.
Yak fighter-bombers from the Minsk, are on the way at this moment. Our E-2C has just
located them heading directly toward our carrier group. Even though the Yaks are no match
for our fighters they can carry stand-off weapons allowing them to launch their attacks
from far away. Your mission is to intercept this strike before it can launch these weapons.

To win this mission you must: shoot down four (4) or more of the in-coming Yak fighters
