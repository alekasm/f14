[BRIEFING]
INTERCEPT THE BOMBERS: Because our "Hawkeye" was eliminated an extra pair of Tomcats are flying CAP. Even so, a large group of Soviet bombers has been able to get within several hundred miles of our carrier before being detected. Using targeting data
 gathered by reconnaissance aircraft, these strike packages will soon launch long-range, ship-killing cruise missiles. These aircraft must be intercepted before they reach their launching points. If even a few of their missiles are able to get throug
h it could mean disaster.

To win this mission you must: shoot down four (4) or more of the in-coming bombers
