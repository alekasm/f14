[BRIEFING]
An Eye for an Eye: You failed to adequately defend our battlegroup against the 
surprise attack. The damage to our forces caused by the raid is reportedly 
considerable. We have since learned from our intelligence sources that a Tu-126 
"Moss" AWACS flying high over the Arctic is acting as a tactical coordinator for these 
missions. Because of the danger posed by a follow-up strike, we must take away their 
"eye-in-the-sky.' The Tu-126 "Moss" must be eliminated. You are ordered to intercept 
and destroy it. You can expect the Soviets to post a heavy fighter escort nearby to 
guard it.

To win this mission you must: shoot down the Tu-126 "Moss"
