[BRIEFING]
RESCUE AT SEA: Brilliant execution! The successful raid against the Soviet surface vessels has
really set back their invasion plans. Unfortunately one of our helicopters in support of the
operation has gone down. Luckily, the survivors have been able to deploy a raft and signal
their position. SAR helicopters are on the way but time is critical. Your mission is to protect
the SAR helicopters from Soviet fighters that are known to be operating in the area.

To win this mission you must: prevent more than one (1) of the SAR helicopters strike from
being shot down by enemy fighters
