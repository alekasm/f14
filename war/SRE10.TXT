[BRIEFING]
TESTING THE WATERS: Outstanding mission! Your success at stopping the surprise attack has
cost the Soviets their best chance at destroying our carrier. Now, having been alerted to the
danger we will be in a much better position to defend against such attacks in the future. The
Soviets have also lost valuable time, time they can't afford to lose if they are to remain on
schedule. Tu-16L "Badger" ELINT aircraft are patrolling at the outer edges of our radar
coverage. They are trying to locate our carrier by detecting our transmissions. These
electronic snoopers must be intercepted before they pinpoint our carrier.

To win this mission you and your wingman must shoot down at least three (3) Tu-16L
"Badgers"
