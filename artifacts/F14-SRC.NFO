These are the .ZIP files from F-14 FLEET DEFENDER PRE-RELEASE package,
the whole F14 is something like 7.5mb so I took these sources from the
original release package and put them here.

If you're some 3D Vector programmer, or want to know whats up with
latest MicroProse programming... these are MUST for you!

Think: full MicroProse Flight Simulation game source codes!  Cool... :)
