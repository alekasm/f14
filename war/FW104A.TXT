[BRIEFING]
EYE FOR AN EYE: The unfortunate failure to eliminate the "Badger" ELINT aircraft has made
our carrier battlegroup vulnerable to a devastating attack. The Soviets have detected our
position through our radar emissions. It won't be long now before our carrier group comes
under attack. The Soviets have stationed a Tu-126 "Moss" AWACS aircraft high over the Arctic.
This aircraft will act as a tactical coordinator for these future air attacks. Because of the
danger posed by such a strike, the Soviet AWACS aircraft must be eliminated. You are ordered
to intercept and destroy the Tu-126 "Moss"

To win this mission you or your wingman must shoot down the Tu-126 "Moss"
