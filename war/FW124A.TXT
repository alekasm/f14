[BRIEFING]
VAMPIRE ...VAMPIRE!: Because the interception mission went so poorly a number of Soviet
bombers have reached their launching points. We are now in an extremely tight situation.
The bombers are about to unleash a rain of cruise missiles on our ships. Our own missile
defenses will likely knock down many of the incoming missiles but not all. You and your
wing-man are the only aircraft in position to stop these missiles before they start landing
among our ships.

To win this mission you must: shoot down as many of the incoming missiles as possible.
Failure to destroy enough of the missiles will likely result in the destruction of the carrier
and loss of the campaign.
