[BRIEFING]
SURPRISE ATTACK: Our carrier battlegroup (CVBG) has been surprised by the sudden
outbreak of war. NATO ground troops in central Europe are falling back under heavy Soviet
pressure. The same is true at sea. Everywhere our ships have been forced to retreat out of
"harm's way." High over the North Cape numerous "Short Horn" search radars have suddenly
illuminated our ships. This can only mean one thing, a flight of Tu-16G "Badgers" is
preparing to launch a salvo of AS-5 "Kelt" anti-ship missiles. You are ordered to intercept
these bombers before they can make their attack.

To win this mission you (and your wing-man) must shoot down a combined total of four (4) or
more incoming Tu-16G bombers.
