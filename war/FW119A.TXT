[BRIEFING]
STRATEGIC STRIKE: Your assistance in recovering the downed air crew will be noted in your
service record. Because of personal heroism you have exhibited, you have been hand-picked
to escort a group of B-52s about to launch a strike on Soviet positions in Norway. This mission
is a test case to study the feasibility of future such attacks. If successful, many more of these
raids will be conducted. If unsuccessful, the operation will be immediately terminated. We
cannot afford to lose these bombers.

To win this mission you must: prevent three (3) or more B-52s from being shot down by
enemy fighters
