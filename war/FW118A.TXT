[BRIEFING]
DEFEND THE HAWKEYE: Our failure to stop the Yaks has convinced the Soviets to try more
elaborate air operations in the future. Before doing so, however, they have come to realize
the necessity of taking out our E-2C AWACS aircraft. A flight of Soviet fighters has been
detected heading on a bee-line for our "Hawkeye." They must be stopped. We are critically
short of replacement aircraft. If we lose the "Hawkeye" our surveillance assets will be
stretched very thin.

To win this mission you must: prevent the E-2C "Hawkeye" from being shot down by enemy
fighters
