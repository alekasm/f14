[BRIEFING]
GOING BEAR HUNTING: Congratulations! The elimination of the Tu-126 "Moss" AWACS has
blinded Soviet naval intelligence for the moment. With the "Moss" gone the Soviets are
unable to coordinate their air strikes or detect our air operations. However, the distinctive
radar signature of many "Big Bulge" search radars has been detected in the distance. This
can only mean one thing, Soviet "Bear" reconnaissance aircraft are out in force trying to
find our carrier group and relay the data to waiting attack aircraft. They must be stopped.

To win this mission you and your wingman must shoot down a combined total of four (4) Tu-
95D "Bears"
