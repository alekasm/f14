[BRIEFING]
INVESTIGATE BOGEYS: Your failure to eliminate the Soviet AWACS has led to a very serious 
situation. By now, the operators onboard the Tu-126 have probably been able to pinpoint our 
carrier's location and target it for another air attack. In the meantime, our E-2C "Hawkeye" 
has spotted aircraft nearby. So far it has been unable to identify them. These bogeys could be 
Soviet fighters, Norwegian ASW patrol craft or even friendly single engine fighters fleeing 
capture on the ground. You are ordered to investigate these bogeys. Approach with caution 
but check 'em out.

To win this mission you and your wingman either escort friendly aircraft back to the carrier 
without losing more than two (2) of them or shoot down at least four (4) of the bogeys if they 
are determined to be hostile
