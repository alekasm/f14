[BRIEFING]
COUNTER-PUNCH: Great job! The successful strike against the amphibious landing has halted 
Soviet ground operations for the moment. We can now turn our attention to hitting the Kiev 
class carrier that was supporting in the landing. It is imperative that the Kiev group be 
stopped so that we won't be bothered by future amphibious landings. Your mission is to escort 
the strike aircraft to their target safely and then return with them to the carrier. 

To win this mission you must: prevent more than three (3) of the A-6E strike aircraft from 
being shot down by enemy fighters
