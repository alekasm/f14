[BRIEFING]
AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT: Your failure to eliminate the MiG-25 has cost the Norwegians dearly. 
Because of the reconnaissance provided by the Foxbat, the Soviets have been able to perform 
a hasty amphibious landing which outflanks the present Norwegian defense line near 
Kirkenes. If the Soviet invasion is not stopped the front will collapse. You are ordered to 
escort a strike package that is preparing to attack the assault ships. A very heavy 
concentration of enemy fighters is expected over the beachhead.

To win this mission you must: prevent more than two (2) of the A-6E strike aircraft from 
being shot down by enemy fighters
