[BRIEFING]
YAK ATTACK: The failure of our airstrike to eliminate the landing vessels has enabled the
Soviets to expand their beachhead. It has even allowed Yak VTOL fighters to begin operating
from within the beachhead perimeter. The Soviets must be denied this forward operating
base (FOB). The entire Norwegian defense line around Kirkenes will collapse unless the
Soviets are forced out. Your mission is to engage the Yaks and destroy them before they can
be used to secure the beach-head. Because of the crucial nature of battle you may expect
additional Soviet fighters to be operating in the area. Norwegian F-16s may also be operating
over the battle so be sure of your targets before firing.

To win this mission you must: shoot down four (4) or more of the Yak fighters surrounding
the landing area
