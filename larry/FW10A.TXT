[BRIEFING]
SURPRISE ATTACK: Our carrier battlegroup has been surprised by the sudden outbreak 
of war. NATO ground troops in central Europe are falling back under heavy Soviet 
pressure. The same is true at sea. Everywhere our ships have been forced to retreat out 
of "harm's way." High over the North Cape numerous "Short Horn" search radars have 
suddenly illuminated our ships. This can only mean one thing, a flight of Tu-16G 
"Badgers" is preparing to launch a salvo of AS-5 "Kelt" anti-ship missiles. You are 
ordered to intercept these bombers before they can make their attack.

To win this mission you (and your wing-man) must shoot down a combined total of 6 or 
more incoming bombers.
