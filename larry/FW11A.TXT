[BRIEFING]
Testing the Waters: Outstanding mission! Your success at stopping the surprise attack 
has cost the Soviets their best chance at destroying our carrier. Now, having been 
alerted to the danger we will be in a much better position to defend against such 
attacks in the future. The Soviets have also lost valuable time, time they can't afford 
to lose if they are to remain on schedule. Tu-16L "Badger" ELINT aircraft are 
patrolling at the outer edges of our radar coverage. They are trying to locate our 
carrier by detecting our transmissions. These electronic snoopers must be 
intercepted before they pinpoint our carrier.

To win this mission you and your wingman must shoot down a combined total of at 
least three (3) Tu-16L "Badgers"
