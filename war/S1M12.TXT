[BRIEFING]
 ONE OF YOUR FELLOW AIRCREWS HAS GONE DOWN ON THEIR WAY BACK TO THE CARIER.
 FORTUNATELY,THEIR RAFTS DEPLOYED AS ADVERTISED AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SIGNAL
 THEIR POSITION AFTER BAILING OUT; ALSO THEIR ELTS (EMERGENCY LOCATOR
 TRANSMITTERS) WEREE WAILLING LIKE BIG DOGS. SAR HELICOPTERS ARE ON THE WAY
 BUT TIME IS CRITICAL.  EXPOSURE WILL KILL A DOWNED AIRCREW WITHIN MINUTES,
 EVEN IF THEY ARE IN A RAFT.  YOUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE HELICOPTERS FROM
 SOVIET FIGHTERS THAT ARE KNOWN IN THE AREA.
